= rujitsu

A ruby gem with various helper methods to smooth out your Ruby development.  

== Install

  gem install brightbox-rujitsu --source http://gems.github.com
  
== Including

  require "rujitsu"
  require "rujitsu/grammar"

For using in irb, there's a nice shortcut for you to use:

  $ irb -rubygems -rujitsu

(This works because <tt>-r</tt> is the argument to require a file, and both 'ubygems.rb' and 'ujitsu.rb' exist.)

=== Rails

To require in rails 2.2, add the following to your <tt>environment.rb</tt> file.

  config.gem "rujitsu"

If you use RSpec you might want to add the following to your <tt>environments/test.rb</tt>:

  config.gem "rujitsu", :lib => "rujitsu/grammar"

== Documentation

Run <tt>rake docs</tt> and open doc/index.html.

== Usage

=== Generating random strings

The Fixnum class has a couple of extensions allowing you to generate random strings.  

  5.random_letters
  5.random_numbers
  5.random_characters
  
You can also generate a variable length string.  

  (3..5).random_letters
  
This generates a string of random letters whose length is 3, 4 or 5 characters.  

<em>(All the above methods exist in the singular too. eg, <tt>1.random_letter</tt>)</em>

=== URL-friendly strings

The String class has an extension that strips out URL-unfriendly characters.  

  ""$%hello!@ 123 there'".to_url # => "hello-123-there" 

=== Truncating strings

The String class has an extension that truncates it to a customisable length with a customisable suffix.

  "this is a string".truncate(:length => 15) # => "this is a st..."
  
=== Testing for inclusion within a container

As Rubyists we are all familiar with using include? to test if our variable is one of a number of values.  

  if ['hello', 'world'].include?(@my_value) ... 
  
However, it doesn't read correctly.  Rujitsu allows you to write the following as it reads much more like English.  

  if @my_value.in? ['hello', 'world'] ... 

=== Grammar

So far the grammar library just adds the method <tt>should_recieve</tt> for rspec assertions. Use it to find out what it does!
